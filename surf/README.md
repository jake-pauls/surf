<p align="center">the <b>surf</b> interpreter.</p>

### Description
The interpreter for the surf language. Can be run with either a provided script or in an interactive repl environment.

### Running
1. Use `opam` to install the project dependencies

```
$ opam install --deps-only .
```

2. Use `dune` to build the project
```
$ dune build
```

3. Run surf in interactive mode, or execute a script
```
$ dune exec surf                # interactive repl
$ dune exec surf script.surf    # run script
```

### Note On Environments
OCaml is incredibly straightforward for Unix environments, and the exact opposite on Windows or Cygwin-based environments.

If this is being run in a Windows environment, I highly recommend installing from [the supported windows installer](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/). While this only runs OCaml in a mingw environment (as opposed to MSVC), it's much less of a struggle to setup. 

Additionally, installing packages using [depext](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/depext-cygwin/) will also ensure that additional packages (especially in Cygwin) are installed automatically, reducing the amount of time spent scowering the Cygwin repos for a dependency.
